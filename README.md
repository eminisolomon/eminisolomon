## 🚀 About Me

Passionate about crafting high-performance distributed systems and cloud-native architectures. I thrive on solving complex problems with elegant code across full-stack development, from frontend interfaces to backend infrastructures and mobile apps.

- 🔧 **Currently building**: Scalable microservices with zero downtime
- 📖 **Currently learning**: Kubernetes orchestration and serverless patterns
- 💡 **Ask me about**: System design, API development, cloud infrastructure, or frontend frameworks
- 😄 **Fun fact**: I debugged a race condition in my sleep!
